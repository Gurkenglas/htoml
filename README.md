toml
====

A [TOML](toml) parser library in [Haskell](hs).

TOML is the obvious, minimal configuration language by [Tom Preston-Werner](guy).

The documentation for this package may (or may not) be found on [Hackage](docs).


### todo

* Add documentation
* Add more tests (maybe find a more mature TOML parser and steal their tests)
* Make all tests pass
* Investigate if the [language agnostic test suite](agno) is interesting for this project
* Make error messages more useful
* See how lenses may (or may not) fit into this package
